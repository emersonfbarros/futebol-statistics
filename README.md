Football statistics is a full stack project where the frontend uses information provided by the backend to show ongoing or finished matches, team statistics, user authentication and much more.
Due to the costs of maintaining a rest api in production you will have to run this project locally.


## Getting Started

Ensuring that you have [node](https://github.com/nodejs/node), version 18 or higher installed, [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker compose](https://github.com/docker/compose), in the root of the project do:

``` shell
npm i && npm compose:up
```

wait a minute. Then access the home page through [localhost:3000](localhost:3000).

To stop application, at the root of the project:

``` shell
npm compose:down
```


## Tests

To run all backend test cases and see their coverage:

```shell
cd app/backend && npm run test-coverage
```
